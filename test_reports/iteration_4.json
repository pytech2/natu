(2) Arrange by GPS Route sorts bills using nearest neighbor algorithm. (3) Generate PDF creates PDF with serial numbers at configurable position/size/color. (4) Split by Employee divides bills equally among N employees and generates separate PDFs. (5) Bills Map shows all 1164 markers with serial numbers and category colors. (6) Property Map page has 3 action buttons but shows 0 properties (data is in 'bills' collection, not 'properties' collection). Note: The 'properties' collection is empty - all property data was uploaded as PDF bills to the 'bills' collection."
